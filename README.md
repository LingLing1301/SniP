# SniP
SniP Software - Better Snipping Tool

## How to build:
0. Make sure Python is installed, version â‰¥ 3.10
1. Open the terminal and enter: `pip install PyQt5 Pillow keyboard pyautogui pyinstaller`
2. Run to get the EXE executable file: `pyinstaller --onefile a.py`

## How to Use:
Press the shortcut key F1 to take a global screenshot

Press the shortcut key F2 to take a screenshot of the area. At this time, you will not be able to click on any content on the screen. Use the left button to drag out a rectangular range, and then press ESC to save it as a PNG file. This function may not be obvious when you use it. But this does take area screenshots, it works

Press F3 to paste the image, paste the picture named screenshot.png on the screen, use the mouse wheel to zoom in on the picture, adjust the position of the picture by dragging the mouse, press F3 again to hide the picture
**Note: It is not recommended to switch the shortcut key of this function frequently, which may cause flashback**

Press F4 to open the screen color picker, this is an external program, not written by me, but it works
